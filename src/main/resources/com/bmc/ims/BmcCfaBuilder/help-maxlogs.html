<p>If you specify a value from 1 through 999, Log Analyzer&nbsp;stops reading log data sets after it reaches the specified number of log data sets. If Log Analyzer&nbsp;does not read other log data sets because the specified limit was reached, a warning message indicates the number of log data sets that were not read.</p>
<p>If you want Log Analyzer to read all log data sets, specify MAXLOGS=999.</p>

<p>The default is MAXLOGS=100 (Log Analyzer reads a maximum of 100 log data sets).</p>
