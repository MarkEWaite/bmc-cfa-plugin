You can use the PRILOG keyword on the ANALYZE control statement to specify the logs type associated with the input RECON data set (or data sets) to use as input to the analysis process.     
<br/>
You can select one of the following values:
<br/>
•	SLDS
<br/>
Process SLDS associated with the input RECON data set (or data sets).
<br/>
•	DLI
<br/>
Process DLI datasets associated with the input RECON data set (or data sets).
<br/>
•	BOTH
<br/>
Process SLDS and DLI datasets associated with the input RECON data set (or data sets).
<br/>
<b>Note:</b>
<br/>
•	If you omit the PRILOG option, Log Analyzer uses the default value SLDS.
<br/>
•	If you select the SLDS keyword, you cannot specify the PRILOG keyword. The PRILOG keyword applies only if CFA is reading RECON data sets to determine which log data sets to process.
