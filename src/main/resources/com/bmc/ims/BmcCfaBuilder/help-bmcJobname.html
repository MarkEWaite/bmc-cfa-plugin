<p>
You can use the JOBNAME keyword on the ANALYZE control statement to specify one or more JOBNAMEs. Each JOBNAME (one to eight characters) identifies a Job name. Log Analyzer uses the JOBNAME when determining which dli log data sets to use as input.
<br/>
To process log records for all Job names that are associated with the input RECON data set (or data sets), specify JOBNAME=ALL.
<br/>
If you omit the JOBNAME sub-keyword, Log Analyzer uses the default value ALL.
<br/>
<b>Note:</b>
<br/>
•	If you specify the DLILOGS keyword, you cannot specify the JOBNAME keyword. The JOBNAME keyword applies only if Log Analyzer is reading RECON data sets to determine which log data sets to process.
<br/>
•	Log Analyzer will process all the jobs in the DLILOGs that get selected by the JOBNAME filter.
<br/>
•	To later filter the report by job name, use the JOB sub-keyword of the APPCHECK report.
