For the Rvr value, specify the literal R followed by the IMS version and release number of the IMS system that created the data set (for example, R151 for IMS version 15.1).
<br/>
<b>Warning:</b>
<br/>
Ensure that the correct release of IMS is specified. The internal layout of IMS log records depends on the version of IMS. If the wrong release is specified, CFA might not be able to detect the error, and results are unpredictable.
