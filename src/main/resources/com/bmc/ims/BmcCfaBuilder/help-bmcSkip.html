You can use the SKIP keyword on the ANALYZE control statement to specify a number (1 through 9999999999) of log records in an input log data set to skip before CFA begins to process records. 
<br/>
The default is SKIP=0, which skips no records. 
<br/>
<b>Note:</b>  
<br/>
If you specify the SKIP keyword, you must specify one SLDS keyword. The SLDS keyword is required, and multiple SLDS keywords are not allowed.
